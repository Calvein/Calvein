## Hey there! I'm Fran√ßois :wave:

#### I'm a senior frontend developer with 12 years of experience, I have primarily worked with React since 2015. I enjoy building performant & eye-catching experiences. I enjoy working remotely on products designed to help people's lives, in a diverse & kind team.
